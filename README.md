The purpose of this report is to read and preprocess data derived from a set of essays, then conduct predictive analysis on this data using machine learning, and finally to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions. The dataset consists of numeric information on a set of student-written essays and with this information the goal is to create an appropriate machine learning model to perform automated essay scoring.
nterest in the possibility of using machine learning algorithms to judge and grade essays similar to a human marker. This particular avenue has massive implications for the future of education as it might lessen the workload for already-overburdened teachers and is possibly more fair as using a model to give out scores removes doubt on any favouritism that may be given to a particular student by a teacher.

Preprocessed data derived from a set of essays (feature selection, normalization, oversampling), then conducted predictive analysis using machine learning models such as SVMs and ensemble classifiers such as Random Forest Classifiers. At the end, the various models' accuracies are evaluated with the help of a confusion matrix and a quadratic kappa score
